            <a href="https://riot.js.org/" target="_blank">Riot</a> is a frontend javascript library that lets you build user interfaces with custom tags using simple and enjoyable syntax. It uses a virtual DOM similar to React but faster. <span class="bold-text">Riot</span> is very tiny compared to its competitors.

            What makes Riot so interesting?<br>
            <ul class="disc-list">
                <li class="bold-text">Easy to learn/use</li>
                <li class="bold-text">Simple & minimalistic</li>
                <li class="bold-text">Small, but complete</li>
                <li class="bold-text">Stable & ready for production</li>
            </ul>

            As a developer one of the main problems i face with new technologies is the learning curve, and after spending time on learning something new there is no guarantee that you will find some projects to work on with the technologies you just learned, you may be just wasting time on learning something you won't use.
            This is why i'm trying to focus more on my choices & this is why i chose Riot ;)

            I recently introduced Riot to my portfolio, you will find the full source code <a href="https://github.com/AXeL-dev/portfolio" target="_blank">here</a> (it stills not the best example out there).

            <a href="https://www.dolibarr.org/" target="_blank">Dolibarr</a> is an opensource and free software package to manage companies, freelancers or foundations. It's basically a web application coded in javascript & PHP that you can use to handle your business on a local or remote server.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            I've been working on Dolibarr for almost 3 years now and here is what i think about it.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            The good part:<br>
            <ul class="disc-list">
                <li><span class="bold-text">Free & opensource</span> (even if the most of external modules are paid)</li>
                <li class="bold-text">Simple installation</li>
                <li class="bold-text">Ergonomic & user friendly interface</li>
                <li class="bold-text">Extensible & customisable</li>
                <li><span class="bold-text">Growing audience</span> (dolibarr is widely used in some countries like France & Greece)</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            The really bad part:<br>
            <ul class="disc-list">
                <li><span class="bold-text">Bugs</span> (you can easily discover a bug just by playing with your browser address bar)</li>
                <li><span class="bold-text">Spaghetti code</span> (no wonder why there is so much bugs..)</li>
                <li><span class="bold-text">Poor documentation</span> (developer documentation is really old & outdated)</li>
                <li><span class="bold-text">Slow development</span> (even if dolibarr has seen very good changes in the last years)</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            As a conclusion, i can say as a developer that a full-rewrite using the new web technologies is maybe required to get a clean & easy to understand base code. Also, providing a good documentation is fundamental, especially for newcomers.

            <span class="bold-text">Note</span>: version 4 is currently in the beta stage, wich means that it's not yet ready for production, but it won't last for long.
